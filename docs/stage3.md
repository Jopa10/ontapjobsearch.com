Ontap – Stage 3 Build (Only If Stage 2 Works)

 CPA negotiations
 Employer direct posting
 Sector-specific subdomains
 Large-scale page generation at marginal cost

Market Context (High Level)
 UK public and quasi-public hiring runs into the hundreds of thousands of roles per year
 Narrow verticals (e.g. NHS, local government, education) are sufficient for scale if unit economics work

Estimated Effort and Cost
 Estimated effort: 3–5 days
 Focused, capped engagement
 Rates revisited only if progressing to Stage 2

Current Status
 Domains and DNS are already set up
 GitHub repository exists and is connected to Vercel
 Deployments are working and ready for Stage 1 code

Initial Vertical Focus
 UK public-sector and charity roles
 Domain deliberately scoped to maximise relevance in Stage 1

Stage 1 Accessibility (Pragmatic)
 Use semantic HTML (proper heading structure, real links)
 Ensure basic colour contrast
 Keyboard accessible by default
 Core content readable without complex JavaScript interactions
 Clear, descriptive link text (e.g. “Apply for role”)
